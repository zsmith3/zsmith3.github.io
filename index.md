# My Projects

Here are some open source projects which I've worked on, mostly alone.

## Photo Manager/Fileserver
<a href="https://github.com/zsmith3/Photo-Manager-Fileserver" class="gh-link">View on GitHub</a>

This is currently the main project I'm working on. Originally inspired by a desire to synchronise photos on a phone and desktop computer without an intermediate cloud service, it now also aims to provide an open source photo management system, with powerful organisational tools. It is very much still in developement, but if you're interested in using it in some capacity, please get in touch (contributions are also greatly appreciated). At some point I'll try and make a working public demo available.

## Music of Minecraft Chrome Extension
<a href="https://github.com/zsmith3/Music-of-Minecraft-Chrome-Extension" class="gh-link">View on GitHub</a>

I made this chrome extension for a friend, who wanted to be able to listen to ambient Minecraft music while browsing. It can be downloaded from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/music-of-minecraft/piidlenoacbeeecjfdkjcgcienfgnkjn).

# Other Projects

These are other people's projects/repositories which I have made contributions to.

## awf/autodiff
<a href="https://github.com/awf/autodiff" class="gh-link">View on GitHub</a>
<a href="https://zsmith3.github.io/autodiff/" class="gh-link">View Homepage</a>

This is a benchmark suite for various automatic differentiation tools, which I contributed to during four weeks at Microsoft Research. I primarily re-organised the repository, making various changes, with the aim of making it easy to install, run and extend.

## Bearle/django-private-chat
<a href="https://github.com/Bearle/django-private-chat" class="gh-link">View on GitHub</a>

I made a very small contribution to this Django-based messaging application, allowing the Websocket server it uses to run in encrypted WSS mode.
