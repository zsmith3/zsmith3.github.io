# About Me

I'm a second year undergraduate student in Mathematics at Cambridge University, with a strong interest in computer science. Aside from what is shown here, I have created lots of smaller projects, including video games in Unity and Java, various websites, and a chat bot. These days I also enjoy competitive programming contests, having won a bronze medal at the 2019 International Olympiad in Informatics.

# My Projects

Here are some open source projects which I've worked on, mostly alone.

## Remote Photo Management System

<a href="https://zsmith3.github.io/Photo-Manager-Client/" class="gh-link">View Homepage</a>

This has been the main project I've worked on in the past several years. Originally inspired by a desire to synchronise photos on a phone and desktop computer without an intermediate cloud service, it now also aims to provide an open source photo management system, with powerful organisational tools. It is very much still in developement, but if you're interested in using it in some capacity, please get in touch (contributions are also greatly appreciated). There is a working public demo available at the homepage linked above.

## Music of Minecraft Chrome Extension

I made this chrome extension for a friend, who wanted to be able to listen to ambient Minecraft music while browsing. It can be downloaded from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/music-of-minecraft/piidlenoacbeeecjfdkjcgcienfgnkjn).

## Connect 4

I made this simple online game of connect 4 in order to experiment with different AI strategies - although sadly haven't yet had the time to try implementing any interesting machine learning based approaches.

# Other Projects

These are other people's projects/repositories which I have made contributions to.

## microsoft/ADBench
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ADBench" class="gh-link">View on GitHub</a>

This is a benchmark suite for various automatic differentiation tools, which I contributed to during four weeks at Microsoft Research in 2018. I primarily re-organised the repository, making various changes, with the aim of making it easy to install, run and extend.

## Bearle/django-private-chat
<a href="https://github.com/Bearle/django-private-chat" class="gh-link">View on GitHub</a>

I made a very small contribution to this Django-based messaging application, allowing the Websocket server it uses to run in encrypted WSS mode.
